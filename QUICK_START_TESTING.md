# Quick Start - Design Page Mockup Testing

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete!

All three missing API endpoints have been added and tested. The design page is ready for testing.

## üöÄ Servers Running

- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000 ‚úÖ
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3001 ‚úÖ

## üß™ Test Products (3+ Ready)

### 1. Bella + Canvas T-Shirt
**URL**: http://localhost:3001/design/71/4025
- Product ID: 71
- Variant ID: 4025
- All API endpoints: ‚úÖ Tested & Working

### 2. Gildan Hoodie
**URL**: http://localhost:3001/design/146/20556
- Product ID: 146
- Variant ID: 20556
- All API endpoints: ‚úÖ Tested & Working

### 3. Gildan Softstyle T-Shirt
**URL**: http://localhost:3001/design/12/598
- Product ID: 12
- Variant ID: 598
- All API endpoints: ‚úÖ Tested & Working

## üìù Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Open Design Page
Click any URL above or paste into browser.

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for these successful API calls:
   - ‚úÖ Fetching product details
   - ‚úÖ Fetching placements
   - ‚úÖ Fetching mockup styles
   - ‚úÖ Fetching printfiles
4. **No red errors should appear**

### Step 3: Visual Verification
- [ ] Product mockup image appears in background
- [ ] Blue dashed rectangle (print area) is visible
- [ ] Product name shows in header
- [ ] Artwork panel shows on left (if sidebar open)
- [ ] Canvas is interactive

### Step 4: Test Artwork
- [ ] Drag artwork from sidebar onto canvas
- [ ] Artwork appears and is draggable
- [ ] Click artwork to select (should show resize handles)
- [ ] Resize and rotate work

### Step 5: Test Text
- [ ] Click "Add Text" button
- [ ] Text appears on canvas
- [ ] Select text to see editing panel
- [ ] Change text content, size, color
- [ ] Changes apply in real-time

### Step 6: Generate Mockup
- [ ] With design on canvas, click "Generate 2D Mockup" or "Generate 3D Mockup"
- [ ] Loading indicator appears
- [ ] Wait 30-60 seconds (Printful processes on their servers)
- [ ] Mockup updates to show your design on the product
- [ ] Design is properly positioned on product

### Step 7: Test Multiple Placements (if available)
- [ ] If placement buttons appear (Front/Back/etc.), click them
- [ ] Canvas switches to show different placement
- [ ] Print area rectangle updates to correct size
- [ ] Can add different designs to each placement

### Step 8: Test Save & Cart
- [ ] Click "Save Design" (requires login)
- [ ] Click "Add to Cart"
- [ ] Verifies design data is preserved

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues (Normal Behavior)

### Mockup Styles Empty
Some products show "No mockup styles" - this is normal for products with the "lifelike" option. Mockup generation still works, Printful will use default 3D rendering.

### Rate Limiting
If you see "Too Many Requests" error:
- This is from Printful's API (tested too much during development)
- Wait 1-2 minutes and try again
- Production usage won't hit this (natural delays between user actions)

### Mockup Generation Time
- 2D mockups: ~20-40 seconds
- 3D mockups: ~30-60 seconds
- This is normal - Printful processes on their servers
- Loading indicator shows progress

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" errors in console
- Check backend is running: http://localhost:5000
- Restart backend if needed: `cd backend; node server.js`

### Blank page or "Cannot GET" error
- Check frontend is running: http://localhost:3001
- Restart frontend if needed: `cd frontend; npm run dev`

### CORS errors
- Restart backend server (CORS config was updated)
- Clear browser cache

### Mockup doesn't generate
- Ensure you have at least one artwork or text on canvas
- Check browser console for specific error
- If rate limited, wait 1-2 minutes
- Try with a different product

## üìä What Was Fixed

1. ‚úÖ Added `/placements` endpoint - gets available print areas
2. ‚úÖ Added `/printfiles` endpoint - gets print area dimensions
3. ‚úÖ Added `/blank-mockup` endpoint - generates blank product images
4. ‚úÖ Enhanced mockup generation - uploads data URLs to Printful automatically
5. ‚úÖ Fixed CORS - allows frontend (port 3001) to access backend
6. ‚úÖ Tested with 3+ products - all working

- **Full Test Results**: `DESIGN_PAGE_MOCKUP_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- **Implementation Summary**: `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`

## üéØ Expected Console Output (No Errors)

When you open a design page, console should show:
```
Fetching product with productId: 71
Product data received: {...}
Found 593 variants
Selected variant: {...}
Fetching placements from: http://localhost:5000/api/catalog/products/71/placements
Placements data: {placements: ['front'], ...}
Fetching mockup styles from: http://localhost:5000/api/catalog/products/71/mockup-styles
Using fallback mockup for front: https://files.cdn.printful.com/...
```

All API calls should return **200 OK**, no errors in red.

## ‚ú® Ready to Test!
