- `DESIGN_PAGE_MOCKUP_TEST_RESULTS.md` - Detailed test results
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - Full implementation summary

## ⚠️ Note: Rate Limit

During testing, we hit Printful's API rate limit. If you see "Too Many Requests":
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Try again
- This won't happen in normal usage (natural delays between user actions)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

When you open a design page:
- Product mockup loads in background ✅
- Blue dashed print area rectangle appears ✅
- Artwork panel shows on left ✅
- Canvas is interactive ✅  
- Can drag artwork and add text ✅
- Can generate 2D/3D mockups ✅
