# GitHub Push Summary - moodyNick Project

## ✅ Successfully Pushed to GitHub
**Repository:** https://github.com/cj1101/moodyNick

## 🔒 Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **Removed Sensitive Files from Git History**
- Completely removed `backend/.env` from all git commits using `git filter-branch`
- This ensures no API keys or secrets are exposed in the repository history

### 2. **Updated .gitignore**
Added comprehensive ignore patterns for:
- All `.env` files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development.local`, etc.)
- Python virtual environments (`venv/`, `env/`, `ENV/`)
- Node modules and build directories
- IDE and OS-specific files

### 3. **Created .env.example Template**
- Added `.env.example` file as a template for other developers
- Shows required environment variables without exposing actual secrets
- Safe to commit to the repository

## 📋 Environment Variables Required

Your application needs these environment variables (create a `backend/.env` file):

```
PRINTFUL_API_KEY=your_printful_api_key_here
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key_here
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/moodynick
JWT_SECRET=your_long_random_jwt_secret_here
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## 🌿 Current Branch Structure

- **main** - Main production branch (pushed)
- **feature/stripe-api-gitignore** - Current working branch (pushed)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Never commit .env files** - They are now properly ignored
2. **Rotate your API keys** - Since the old `.env` was previously pushed, consider rotating:
   - Stripe API keys (secret and publishable)
   - Printful API key
   - JWT secret
   - Any database credentials

3. **For new team members** - They should:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `backend/.env`
   - Fill in their own API keys and secrets

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional)

You may want to:
1. Merge `feature/stripe-api-gitignore` into `main` if you're satisfied
2. Rotate any API keys that were previously exposed
3. Set up GitHub Secrets for CI/CD if needed
